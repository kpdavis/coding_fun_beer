# Coding Fun in React-Redux with external Api with "GET", "POST", "PUT".

This is my first attempt at a react app.
Built using the create-react-app cli.
A front-end that attaches to client Api at "http://beer.fluentcloud.com/v1/beer".

The Front-end:
1. GET: all beers on "/" and a single beer at api/beers/:id.
2. POST: Add a new beer to Api.
3. PUT: Update the likes to a beer


### Steps
* [x] Learn React-Redux
  * [] set up component for react
    * [x] Show list of beers
    * [x] Show single beer
    * [] Add a beer
    * [] Edit beer
  * [x] Attach Redux to set store and manage  virtual DOM
